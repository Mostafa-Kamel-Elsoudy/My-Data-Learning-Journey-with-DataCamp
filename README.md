## ðŸŽ“ Courses Completed

Here are some of the **DataCamp courses** Iâ€™ve completed so far, mainly focused on **Python, SQL, and data engineering tools**:

1. [Introduction to Python for Developers](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/introduction-to-python-for-developers)  
2. [Intermediate Python for Developers](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/Intermediate-python-for-developers)  
3. [Introduction to SQL for Data Science](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/intro-to-sql-for-data-science) *(planned/ongoing)*  
4. [Data Engineering Toolbox](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/data-engineering-toolbox) *(planned/ongoing)*  

Each course folder contains:
- A summary of the course content  
- Completed exercises and code implementations  
- Key takeaways and best practices

## ðŸ›  Projects

Projects demonstrate the application of **data engineering concepts** such as **ETL pipelines, data wrangling, and workflow automation**.

### Project 1: Data Cleaning and Transformation  
- **Description**: Built a pipeline to clean raw datasets, handle missing values, and prepare structured data for analysis.  
- **Tech stack**: Python (pandas, numpy), SQL  

### Project 2: Automating a Data Pipeline  
- **Description**: Designed and implemented an automated ETL process to extract data, transform it into a usable format, and load it into a relational database.  
- **Tech stack**: Python, SQL, Airflow *(conceptual)*

## ðŸ“ˆ Skills Developed

Through my learning journey, Iâ€™ve developed skills relevant to **data engineering and analytics**:

- **Programming & Scripting**: Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib)  
- **Data Engineering**: ETL concepts, workflow automation, data pipelines  
- **Databases & Querying**: SQL (joins, aggregations, subqueries)  
- **Data Manipulation & Analysis**  
- **Data Visualization** for insights and reporting  
- **Machine Learning Basics** (model evaluation & optimization)
