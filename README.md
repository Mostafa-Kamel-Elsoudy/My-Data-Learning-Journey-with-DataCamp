## 🔹 Introduction

This repository is both a **learning log** and a **mini-portfolio** for my journey in the **data domain**, with a strong focus on:

- **Data engineering**
- **Data pipelines**
- **Scalable data solutions**

Inside, you’ll find:

- **Course notes**
- **Hands-on projects**
- **Practice exercises**

Each item is designed to show how I apply concepts to **practical, real-world scenarios**.

## 🎓 Courses & Tracks

I’m using **DataCamp** to build a solid foundation in **Python**, **SQL**, and **data engineering tools**.

### ✅ Completed / In Progress

1. [Introduction to Python for Developers](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/introduction-to-python-for-developers)  
2. [Intermediate Python for Developers](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/Intermediate-python-for-developers)  

### 🚧 Planned / Ongoing

3. [Introduction to SQL for Data Science](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/intro-to-sql-for-data-science) *(ongoing)*  
4. [Data Engineering Toolbox](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/data-engineering-toolbox) *(ongoing)*  

Each course folder (when available) includes:

- A **summary** of the course content  
- **Code implementations** and completed exercises  
- **Key takeaways** and **best practices**

## 🛠 Projects

These projects demonstrate how I apply **data engineering concepts** such as ETL, data wrangling, and workflow design.

### 📁 Project 1: Data Cleaning and Transformation

- **Description**:  
  Built a pipeline to clean raw datasets, handle missing values, standardize formats, and prepare structured data for downstream analysis.

- **Tech stack**:  
  `Python (pandas, numpy)`, `SQL`

---

### 📁 Project 2: Automating a Data Pipeline

- **Description**:  
  Designed an automated ETL process to **extract** data from source files, **transform** it into a consistent schema, and **load** it into a relational database.

- **Tech stack**:  
  `Python`, `SQL`, basic `Airflow` concepts (workflow orchestration – conceptual)

---

## 📈 Skills Developed
